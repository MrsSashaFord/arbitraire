the larger limit is, unless its a power of 2, the more biased random()%limit will be
for example if limit is 2/3 the max possible value, the lower half of the possible outputs will have twice the 
                probability of the upper half
really what you want is something like do x = random(); while (x > INT32_MAX/limit*limit); x %= limit;

not sure that's exactly right but it's close

(basically, divide the outputs into equal-sized bins and a remainder bin, and retry if you hit the remainder one)
