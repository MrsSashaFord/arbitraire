Hypothesis:

There are two ways to do comba multiplication.

	1> add all rows together and perform the final carry at the end = overflows
	2> perform the carries on each row = typical overflow occurence of a*b

If you did want to make a single carrying pass then one could just have a single row?


The number of rows needed is essentially the number of digits of the largest operand
