This is a proposal for a mathematics invention

the invention consists of guessing mechanism and a state machine 

From here on out it will be referred to as 'fastguess'


Fastguess partitions numbers so as to arrive at a fast guess of the target number. It
can be used in division and square root algorithms


In long-hand square root, as is attributed to Fibonacci there are guesses of the form

XXXn * n, where XXX is a known value and 'n' would generally start at zero and be incremented
toward the correct solution

fastguess instead partitions the value of 'n' against the working base and for base 10 would
work as follows
	'n' starts off as Base/2, which would be 5 for base 10, it is tested to see if it is
	greater than or less than the target solution. if it is less than the target solution
	base/2 + base/4 is tried, which with unsigned mathematics base/4 would be 2 and base/2
	would be 5 and the result be a guess of 7.

	In order to expand on these properties we must introduce a state machine which shows
	whether or not the solution has been passed up. in the case that base/2+base/4 or 7
	is greater than the tagrt solution and base/2 has been tried and shown to be less, the
	state machine is activated to "ON" and this "ON" would indicate that it is time to start
	narrowing in on the solution using from the last guess that was below the target solution
	so, if that last guess was Base/2 and Base/2 + Base/4 exceeds the solution we would know
	to either work up form Base/2 or down from Base/2+Base/4
